### Lightweight UAV RFFI 

Z. Cai, Y. Wang, Q. Jiang, G. Gui and J. Sha, "Toward Intelligent Lightweight and Efficient UAV Identification With RF Fingerprinting," \emph{IEEE Internet of Things J.}, vol. 11, no. 15, pp. 26329--26339, Aug., 2024, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2024.3395466.

This paper propose an efficient and low-complexity RFFI method for UAV identification. Specifically, we design a lightweight backbone network consisting of lightweight multi-scale convolution (LMSC) blocks that can significantly reduce the model size and enhance the feature extraction ability.
