### Lightweight UAV RFFI 

This paper propose an efficient and low-complexity RFFI method for UAV identification. Specifically, we design a lightweight backbone network consisting of lightweight multi-scale convolution (LMSC) blocks that can significantly reduce the model size and enhance the feature extraction ability.
